```

```
near login 
```

- after you near login replace the FUNDER_ACCOUNT with your account
- change the DAO name with your DAO and a custom message and the specific role (case sensistive) you want to add these members to. 
- you can also changed the deposit per link to a larger or smaller amount depending how muhc NEAR you want to load each account win
- put telegram api key and chatID (use telegram raw bot to get your chat id https://t.me/RawDataBot) in .env (check example.ev) 
- make sure in your DAO the v2.keypom.near contract has permission to add_member as a porposal. Note this does not allow for autoregistration to prevent the keypom contract from having to much permission over your DAO.
